In a study recently published in Science Advances, several researchers from Xiamen University in China report the synthesis and characterization of a pentadentate, five-carbon, chelating molecule. This planar molecule coordinates osmium and is amenable to several substituents. Furthermore, its properties make it a good candidate for photothermal therapy.
The current study builds on work by this group in which they found that the ligand's Mobius aromaticity plays a key role in stabilizing the metal center. Mobius aromaticity stems from molecular orbital theory in which an aromatic ring's pi-donating atomic orbitals rotate around the ring like a Mobius strip. This study reports the synthesis of a ligand with planar 12-center 12-electron d?-p? pi-conjugation, the largest planar Mobius aromatic system reported. It is comprised of two fused five-member rings, a six-member ring, and a three-member, non-aromatic ring.
Structurally, the five carbon donor atoms are in the same plane (equatorial) while the two phosphorous atoms are in the axial plane. The osmium metal is almost co-planar with the carbon atoms. The C-Os bond lengths indicate delocalized bonds. As reported by the authors of the study, this structure represents the highest coordination number for a metal atom coordinated to carbon donor atoms in planar geometry.
The synthesis of these planar pentadentate compounds was fairly straight-forward involving a ring expansion with alkynes or allenes with various substituents. The first product, resulting in phenyl substituents on the six-membered ring and the three-member ring was made with 3-ethynylthiophene and silver borohydride at room temperature. This product, as well as the ones with cyclohexane, cyclopropane, and thiophene substituents was characterized with NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis, all of which confirmed a pentagonal bipyramidal structure and delocalized Os-C bonds.
